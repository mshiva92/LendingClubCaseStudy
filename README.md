## General Information
A finance company named 'Lending Club' specialises in lending various types of loans to customers. When the company receives a loan application, it has to make a decision for loan approval based on the applicant’s profile. <br>

There are two types of risks are associated with the bank’s decision:

(i) If the applicant is likely to repay the loan, then not approving the loan results in a loss of business to the company.<br>
(ii) If the applicant is not likely to repay the loan, i.e. he/she is likely to default, then approving the loan may lead to a financial loss for the company<br>

Based on the dataset "loan.csv" company wants to understand the driving factors (or driver variables) behind loan default, i.e. the variables which are strong indicators of default.
